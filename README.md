# Amazing Mazes

Amazing mazes is little game engine created just for fun.

Play at [https://apollonet.github.io/amazing-mazes/](https://apollonet.github.io/amazing-mazes/)

## Create a new maze

A maze is defined in Json format, with these settings:

`name` (string): name of the maze

`light` (int):

- `0`: light of the entire maze is off (default)
- `1`: light of the entire maze is on

`hero` (object):

- `name` (string): name of the hero (default: `Frodorik`)
- `icon` (string): a unicode icon that represents the hero (default: `ü§∫`)
- `hp` (int): number of health points at start (default: `0`)
- `strength` (int): number of strength point at start (default: `0`)

`cells` (array): cells of the maze. See below for detailed informations

`events` (array): events attached to cells. See below for detailed informations

## Icons

You can find unicode icons at [https://unicode-table.com/](https://unicode-table.com/), for instance.

## Cells

`cells` is an array of arrays. Each sub-array is a **row**. In each row, each item is a **cell**, defined by a string. That string defines the walls of the cell. It can only contain four letters:

- `t` for Top
- `r` for Right
- `b` for Bottom
- `l` for Left

For instance, a cell with `tbl` will have walls at its top, bottom and left sides.

And here is a little maze that has 3 rows and 3 columns:

```
"cells": [
    ["tl", "tb", "tr"],
    ["rl", "trl", "rl"],
    ["bl", "rb", "rbl"]
  ],
```

## Events

Each event will be attached to a cell. It is used for different purposes.
It is defined like this:

`r` (int): Row of the cell the event will be attached to. We start counting at zero, it is real computer programming here ;-)

`c` (int): Column of the cell will be attached to. Starts at zero too.

`name` (string): One of these: 

- `start`: defines the start cell
- `win`: defines the win cell
- `message`: simply emit a message
- `metrix`: changes a metrix value (hp, strength...). See details below.
- `object`: adds an object to the hero's objects
- `fight`: fight an opponent
- `move`: moves the hero to another cell
- `light`: switches the lights of the entire maze on or off
- `reveal`: switches the lights on of the some cells

`message` (string): The message displayed when the hero comes to that event's cell. HTML markup libe `<br>` can be used here.

`icon` (string): A unicode icon displayed when the hero comes to that event's cell.

`once` (int):

- `0`: the event occurs each time the hero comes to that event's cell
- `1`: the event occurs only one time (default)

### Start event

Example:

```
"r": 3,
"c": 4,
"name": "start",
"message": "Find the hidden treasure"
```

The game starts at the cell at the 4th row, 5th column.

The message "Find the hidden treasure" is displayed along with the default icon.

### Win event

Example:

```
"r": 8,
"c": 13,
"name": "win",
"message": "You found the hidden treasure",
"icon": "üë∏"
```

The game is won when the hero arrives at the cell at the 9th row, 14th column.

The message "You found the hidden treasure" is displayed along with the icon üë∏.

The game is over: play again or choose another maze...

### Message event

The event can be used to display a message written on a paper that was found, a warning from a sign, etc...

Example:

```
"r": 4,
"c": 3,
"name": "message",
"message": "Beware of the dragon",
"icon": "üñπ"
```

At cell at the 5th row, 4th column, the message "Beware of the dragon" is displayed with the icon "üñπ".

### Metrix event

The metrix event needs mandatory setings:

- `metrix` (string): Values can be `hp` or `strength`
- `effect` (string): Values can be `earn` or `lose`
- `points` (int): How many points are gained or losen on which metrix

It is used to add or remove some hp or strength to the hero.

Example:

```
"r": 1,
"c": 0,
"name": "metrix",
"message": "You found a Talisman",
"object": "talisman",
"metrix": "hp",
"effect": "earn",
"points": 5,
"icon": "üâ§"
```

At cell 2nd row and 1st column, the message displayed is "You found a Talisman" with the icon "üâ§".

And the hero `earn` `5` `hp`.

### Object event

Example:

```
"r": 2,
"c": 3,
"name": "object",
"message": "You found a torch and see further",
"effect": "earn",
"object": "torch",
"icon": "üî¶"
```

A "üî¶" torch is added to the hero objects when he comes on the cell at the 3rd row, 4th column.

### Fight event

The fight event event is defined with mandatory settings :

- `opponent` (string): name of the opponent
- `hp` (int): health points of the opponent
- `attacks` (array): attacks of the opponent

Each attack is an object defined with :

- `name` (string): name of the attack
- `hp` (int): number of health points inflicted

Example:

```
"r": 3,
"c": 0,
"name": "fight",
"message": "You woke up a dragon",
"opponent": "Dragon",
"hp": 100,
"attacks": [
  {
    "name": "Red fire",
    "hp": 50
  },
  {
    "name": "Tail stroke",
    "hp": 10
  }
],
"icon": "üêâ"
```

At cell at 4th row, 1st column, you enter the fight mode.

The message "You woke up a dragon" is displayed with the icon üêâ.

The opponent is Dragon, it has 100 hp. Its attacks are

### Move event

This event can be used as a fall, a teleportation...

Example:

```
"r": 2,
"c": 2,
"name": "move",
"message": "You teleported",
"to": {
  "r": 3,
  "c": 8
},
"icon": "üó≤",
"once": 0
```

At cell that is at 3rd row, 3rd column , the hero is moved to the cell at the 5th row and 9th column.

The message "You teleported" is displayed with the icon üó≤.

The event is not triggered once. If the hero returns to this cell, the event occurs again: hero is moved, message is displayed...

### Light event

Example:

```
"r": 0,
"c": 3,
"name": "light",
"once": 0
```

At cell at 1st row, 4th column, the `light` of the entire maze is switched on/off.

But the cells where the hero already passed are still visible.

This is the same `light` that was defined at the top of the settings.

### Reveal event

The reveal event needs a mandatory setting:

`cells` (array): Each item of this array is an object that defines a cell with its row (`r`) and column (`c`)

It can be used to light on arbitrary cells : a room, a corridor...

Example:

```
"r": 8,
"c": 7,
"name": "reveal",
"message": "A big fire lit in the middle of the room",
"icon": "üî•",
"cells": [
  {"r": 7, "c": 8},
  {"r": 7, "c": 9},
  {"r": 7, "c": 10},
  {"r": 8, "c": 8},
  {"r": 8, "c": 9},
  {"r": 8, "c": 10},
  {"r": 9, "c": 8},
  {"r": 9, "c": 9},
  {"r": 9, "c": 10}
]
```

When the hero is on the cell at 9th row, 8th column, the room defined by the `cells` array are lit.

There a TODO.md file next to this README.md file, just sayin.
