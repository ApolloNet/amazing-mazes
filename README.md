# Amazing Mazes

Amazing mazes is a little game engine created just for fun.

Play at [https://apollonet.github.io/amazing-mazes/](https://apollonet.github.io/amazing-mazes/)


# Create a new maze

‚úé First, grab a pencil and an eraser and draw your maze on [graph paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_paper).

Then, have a look at the /mazes directory for examples.

## The Json file

A maze is defined in Json format, with these settings:

`name` (string, required): name of the maze

`authors` (string, optional): names of the creators of the maze

`light` (int, optional):

- 0: light off the entire maze (default)
- 1: light on the entire maze

`hero` (object, optional): See below for detailed informations

`cells` (array, required): cells of the maze. See below for detailed informations

`events` (array, required): events attached to cells. See below for detailed informations


# Icons

You can find unicode icons at [https://unicode-table.com/](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/miscellaneous-symbols-and-pictographs/), for instance.

Simply copy / paste. It's just text.


# Hero

The hero is defined with the following params.

Each one has defaults. Just add the ones you want to override in your json maze file.

`name` (string, optional, default: "Frodorik"): name of the hero

`icon` (string, optional, default: ü§∫): a unicode icon that represents the hero

`hp` (int, optional, default: 100): number of health points at start

`attacks` (array, optional): attacks used in fights

## Attacks

Attacks is an array of objects. Each one contains :

`name` (string, required): name of the attack

`hp` (int, required): hp damages

`icon` (string, optional, default: hero icon): icon of the attack

Defaults are stored in the /js/config.attacks.js file


# Cells

`cells` is an array of arrays. Each sub-array is a **row**. In each row, each item is a **cell**, defined by a string. That string defines the walls of the cell. It can only contain four letters:

- `t` for Top
- `r` for Right
- `b` for Bottom
- `l` for Left

For instance, a cell with `tbl` will have walls at its top, bottom and left sides.

And here is a little maze that has 3 rows and 3 columns:

```
"cells": [
    ["tl", "tb", "tr"],
    ["rl", "trl", "rl"],
    ["bl", "rb", "rbl"]
  ],
```


# Events

Each event will be attached to a cell. It is used for different purposes.
It is defined like this:

`r` (int, required): row of the cell the event will be attached to.

`c` (int, required): column of the cell will be attached to. Starts at zero too.

For rows and columns, we start counting at zero. It is real computer programming here ;-)

`type` (string, required): see below for detailed informations

`message` (string, required): the message displayed when the hero comes to that event's cell. HTML markup libe `<br>` can be used here.

`icon` (string, optional): a unicode icon displayed when the hero comes to that event's cell.

`visible` (int, optional, default: 1):

- 0: the icon of the event is not visible on the maze
- 1: the icon is visible

`once` (int, optional, default: 1):

- 0: the event occurs each time the hero comes to that event's cell
- 1: the event occurs only one time

## Event types

`start`: defines where the game starts

`win`: defines where the game ends

`fight`: fight an opponent

`learn`: learn an attack

`light`: switches the lights of the entire maze on or off

`message`: display a message

`metrix`: changes a metrix value (only "hp" for the moment). See details below.

`move`: moves the hero to another cell

`mutate`: transforms the hero's name, icon and hp

`object`: adds an object to the hero's objects

`over`: game over

`protected`: the hero can only come on this cell if he has got the appropriate object

`question`: the hero can only come on this cell if he answers the question properly

`reveal`: switches the lights on of the some cells

## Required events

Only `start` and `win` events are mandatory to create a simple maze game.


# Start event

The start event is used on the cell where the game starts.

Only one start event is allowed.

## Example

```
"r": 3,

```

The game starts at the cell at the 4th row, 5th column.

The message "Find the hidden treasure" is displayed along with the default icon.


# Win event

The win event is used on the cell where the game is won.

There could be multiple win events.

## Example

```

The event is not triggered once. If the hero returns to this cell, the event occurs again: hero is moved, message is displayed...


# Mutate event

This event is used to transform the hero's name, icon, hp and attacks.

## Params

`hero` (object): Same params as the top definition of the hero.

# Protected event

The protected event can be used to lock cells that are reachable only if the hero has got a certain object.

The simple usage is: a cell is locked behind a door, it needs a key to be unlocked.

## Params

`success` (object, required): what is needed to unlock and what happens what it's done

The `success` object is defined like :

`object` (string, required): the object's (exact same) name that can unlock this protected cell

`message` (string, required): the message to display when it's unlocked

`icon` (string, required): the icon to display when it's unlocked

## Example

```
"r": 8,
"c": 6,
"type": "protected",
"message": "The door is locked. You should find a key",
"icon": "üö™",
"success": {
  "object": "old key",
  "message": "You unlocked the door with the old key",
  "icon": "üóù"
}
```

The cell at 9th row, 7th column is not reachable if you don't have the `old key` object.

If you try to move there, the message "üö™ The door is locked. You should find a key" is displayed.

But if you have found the `old key`, you move there and the message "üóù You unlocked the door with the old key" is displayed.

Of course, an object event was used elsewhere in the maze, with the `old key` object. Something lihe this :

```
"r": 2,
"c": 2,
"type": "object",
"message": "You found an old key",
"icon": "üóù",
"object": "old key"
```


# Question event

This event is used to ask the hero a question. If they answer properly, they can pass.

## Params

`success` (object, required): expected answer and icon and message displayed if answer is correct

`failure` (object, required): icon and message displayed if answer is not correct

`rewards` (object, optional): see the fight event for details

Both `success` and `failure` objects must contain those params:

`message` (string, required)

`icon` (string, required)

The `success` object also needs :

`answer` (string, required): the answer to the question

‚ö† The answer **is not** case sensitive. Ie: 'Horcrux' will match 'HORCRUX' or 'horcrux'

## Example

```
"r": 3,
"c": 7,
"type": "question",
"message": "What's your animal name?",
"icon": "üßù",
"once": 1,
"success": {
  "answer": "tiger",
  "message": "Right answer, you can pass",
  "icon": "üêÖ"
},
"failure": {
  "message": "Wrong answer, you shall not pass",
  "icon": "üßù"
},
"rewards": [
  {
    "type": "metrix",
    "message": "Here is an old Talisman, it will help you in your quest",
    "object": "talisman",
    "metrix": "hp",
    "effect": "earn",
    "points": 20,
    "icon": "üâ•"
  }
]
```

# Reveal event

It can be used to light on arbitrary cells : a room, a corridor...

## Params

`cells` (array, required): Each item of this array is an object that defines a cell with its row (`r`) and column (`c`)

## Example

```
"r": 8,
"c": 7,
"type": "reveal",
"message": "A big fire lit in the middle of the room",
"icon": "üî•",
"cells": [
  {"r": 7, "c": 8},
  {"r": 7, "c": 9},
  {"r": 7, "c": 10},
  {"r": 8, "c": 8},
  {"r": 8, "c": 9},
  {"r": 8, "c": 10},
  {"r": 9, "c": 8},
  {"r": 9, "c": 9},
  {"r": 9, "c": 10}
]
```

When the hero is on the cell at 9th row, 8th column, the "room" defined by the `cells` array are lit.
